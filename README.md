## Features

* Screen sharing with audio
* Peer-to-Peer connection using PeerJS
* Simple interface
* Mute/Unmute local and remote audio(Untested yet.)

## Limitations

* Currently only supports two users at a time.
* Won't work on mobile.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/seenmttai/pairscreen.git
   cd pairscreen
   ```

2. **Open index.html:**
   
   * Share your generated peer id with the person you want to connect with or type the peer id of the person you want to connect to.


## Remarks

* Peerjs is just too easy! I never thought it would be this easy when I first googled it.
* The people who created the concept of utility classes had god level creativity! Oh, I love tailwind so much.
* Vue.js is pretty great too. It was the first time I used it so I might have missed some places I could have used it but didn't. I don't think so though, the applications of dynamic variables are so broad that its really obvious where to use it.
